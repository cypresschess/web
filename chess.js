But by playing a new move (9. ... Qc7) Black set White a significant number of problems. Eventually White lost their way and Black was left with a winning position. It seems that the line actually works for Black, although trying to find other examples was difficult (only a few games against 1900 rated players).

The other significant thing about his win, is at the age of 8 years old, I am almost certain he would be the youngest winner of the ACT Junior Championship.
