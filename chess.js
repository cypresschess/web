However, when Rapport avoided the second repetition, he ended up losing his queen for insufficient compensation, with a loss to show for his trouble. After the game Rapport suggested it was the result of poor preparation, although this move he played was already known to be bad.

         "description" : " The world champion's 2018 and 2021 challengers are clear of their rivals, and the Norwegian's resolve to decline a new series against an opponent from his own generation could soon be tested After six of the 14 rounds at the world championship Candidates in Madrid, Ian Nepomniachtchi and Fabiano Caruana, the 2021 and 2018 title challengers, have broken away from their rivals. The pair will meet in Monday's ninth round (2pm start, live and free to watch on major chess websites) in what could be the tournament decider. It is a surprise result so far, and one which may test the resolve of the world champion, Magnus Carlsen, who has said that he is unlikely to defend his crown again if the oppo",
