In fact, he felt very optimistic about his position against Jan-Krzysztof Duda. He felt that his queen and rook were flooding towards the kingside. The other former world champion in his team, Yifan Hou scored the second decisive game of the match against Alexandra Kosteniuk. Thus, Chingari Gulf Titans lost to Ganges Grandmasters 0-3 (4-10) without conceding a single match. Four matches will be played tomorrow starting with SG Alpine Warriors vs Balan Alaskan Knights from 2 p.m. local time. Photo: Jio Cinema live stream",
