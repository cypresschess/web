         "description" : "Jan-Krzysztof Duda has qualified for the 2022 Candidates Tournament in spectacular style by beating Magnus Carlsen to reach the final of the FIDE World Cup. The victory was utterly deserved, with Duda yet to lose a game at the World Cup and never in real danger against Magnus, while the World Champion could have escaped but found himself under immense pressure in the second rapid game. Duda now plays fellow Candidate Sergey Karjakin, while Magnus faces a 3rd place match against Vladimir Fedoseev. Tan Zhongyi took 3rd in the women's event after easily overcoming Anna Muzychuk.",

After beating FM Michael Kethro in round 5, he recovered from a losing position against Willis Lo to score the full point. In part he was aided by the need for Lo to win the game, as Lo avoided a repetition at one point, and in time trouble missed a saving move with his queen. IM Junta Ikeda (5/6) finished in 2nd place after beating WFM Alana Chibnall in the final round, while Fred Litchfield took outright third on 4.5. With only twenty players in the top section, the competition was fierce throughout, with Press's 6 games all being against players who finished in the next 6 places. Donghoon Shin won the Minor (Under 1600) ",
