The general consensus (from the people who had been involved in hybrid events) was that it was a lot of extra work for little extra reward. The main reason given for this was that it didn't offer ratings and titles. Of course this is due to the fact that it doesn't exactly match the format for OTB events, but there is also an undercurrent concerning the risk of cheating. The slightly strange thing is that players seem a little happier to play low key events for online rating",

The rook move is an interesting alternative to the deeply analysed main line 9...Qb6. Meanwhile, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov in particular has tried 9...Rb8 in a number of games, and Levon Aronian recently came up with an entirely new move: 9...Bb7.
