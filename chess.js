Nepomniachtchi was certain he had something against Caruana's idea but didn't remember what it was. Nepomniachtchi fell about 50 minutes behind on the clock but it was here Caruana began to slow down and then made a mistake. You have to think the very long games Caruana has been playing and yesterday's disappointment couldn't have helped but he needed to find 24.Bf1! after 24.Bxf5? he almost certainly missed 27...Nd3 ahead of times and after this it was Caruana who had to be careful as he got into time pressure, but the players repeated at move 40.",

Nepo played a line in the Petroff where Black sacrifices a rook, but draws by perpetual check soon afterwards. However Rapport rejected the first repetition, although this simply forced Nepo to aim for another repetition a few moves later. However, when Rapport avoided the second repetition, he ended up losing his queen for insufficient compensation, with a loss to show for his trouble. After the game Rapport suggested it was the result of poor preparation, although this move he played was already known to be bad. But not only did this game effect Nepo's standings, it also had an effect on Caruan",

He decided to deal with it my taking on d4, assuming that my next move would be to capture the bishop on f5. Instead the knight landed on c6, and thanks to the pinned b pawn, I successfully attacked the queen, both rooks and a bishop, all of which were undefended! <br /> <b>Press,Shaun - Hosking,Ian [D11]</b><br />Belconnen Cup (6), 21.06.2022 <script>new PgnViewer( { boardName: \"game1333\", movesFormat: \"default\", pgnString:'",
