Some pieces had a single direction, while more powerful pieces had 2,3 or 4 directions.

Signs of life are starting to appear though, with the decision to hold the 2023 Oceania in Melbourne in January 2023. Teams are starting to get themselves organised for the Olympiad, and there is also talk of a possible Oceania Juniors in 2022 (or 23), and an Oceania Seniors. Unlike almost all other FIDE zones, air travel is the key to the success of these events, so hopefully the opening of borders between the various countries will see renewed enthusiasm for these tournaments. <br /> ",

As a result we have extended the size of the event to 120, but it is unlikely that it will be increased further. At the moment there are 20 places left in the Major (Under 2000 ACF), so if you wish to play the Major, you should get your entries in quick. At the moment there are over 200 entries for the event, and with 5 weeks before the event starts, a field well in excess of 300 is expected. If you are eligible for two divisions (due to an overlap in rating requirements), picking the less crowded of the 2 would be great ",
