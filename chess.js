Eight out of sixteen players moved on to the knockout, with Jan-Krzysztof Duda the top scorer in the single round-robin. Suspense regarding who would make it through was limited to two players, as Anish Giri and Vidit Gujrathi entered the fifteenth round with chances of getting the coveted eighth spot in the knockout. In the end, it was Vidit who advanced to the quarterfinals, mainly thanks to Arjun Erigaisi's victory over Giri.",
