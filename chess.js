This was completely different to yesterday's game, Gukesh chose the Reti and Ding chose a sharp variation which got him into trouble as he didn't seem to fancy the complications when he got there. Ding thought for about an hour over his fourth and fifth moves and put himself in time trouble right from the start. This was clearly a sign of indecision. Gukesh's 5.a3 was shown to him last night and he actually lost his advantage quite quickly, 9.d3=. Gukesh caught up on the clock with a huge think to find 11.g3 but then after 15.Rd1?! e6 or 15....Qb8 would have left",

Anyhow after 12.Nd4 white had a very nice knight and a minority attack on the Queenside, not super scary but at least something. Gukesh is known for his very concrete calculative approach and 13....
