It offers room for a wide range of topics, e.g. Dorian Rogozenco's video presentation of rediscovered Kasparov games in ChessBase Magazine #195, \"My favourite Fischer game\" (CBM #196), \"Kasparov as challenger\" (CBM #198), \"My favourite game of Paul Keres\" (CBM 199) or how people remember the young Magnus Carlsen (CBM #200). The current issue #201 focuses on a player who has been among the world's best for more than three decades: Vassily Ivanchuk. The \"Ivanchuk Special\" in CBM #201 includes 22 games from 1987 to 2019. As a sample we show two of these games, annotated by Renato Quintilliano and David Navara. Enjoy!",
