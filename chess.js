         "description" : " For no particular reason I decided to see what was opening in the Bundesliga, which is running as I speak. Almost all the games were still in the opening stage, and yet one game was already finished. At first I thought it was a forfeit, or even worse, a mobile phone default, but instead it was just a misplayed opening that was quickly punished. White didn't play any outright blunders (in the usual sense), but every move seemed to make the position worse. Realising that f2 was about fall, White decided that they had seen enough. <br /> <b>Pitl,Jarno (1988) - Wegerle,Joerg (2404) [A04]</b><br />Schachbundesliga chess24.com (2.8), 06.03.2022 <script>new PgnViewer( { boardName: \"game1315\", move",

In the preliminaries there are three points for a win and one for a draw and money for each win. The KO phase is slightly accelerated with only one 4 game mini-match before a blitz tie-break in the quarter and semi-finals but the final is still over two mini-matches before the tie-break.

The fact that Nakamura then won the final was even more of a shock, as he has hardly lifted a piece in 2 years, concentrating on streaming instead. Nonetheless the result showed that the group of \"thirty something\" Super GM's still will take some beating by the next generation of GM's. ",
