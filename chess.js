Gukesh returned to 1.e4 and the French Defence was again played by Ding. 7.a3 was already rare, \"a move order trick\" according to Ding and the players were soon on their own. The position became extremely unbalanced after 10...Nc4 11.Bxc4. Maybe Gukesh should have tried 12.Qg4, the engine's preference but over the board he didn't see its merits. 17.Q",
