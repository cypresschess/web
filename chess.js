Had he done so, it would have been an attacking masterpiece, but even world champions slip from time to time. The winner of that match will face the winner of the all-Russian clash between Daniil Dubov vs. Andrey Esipenko, which is also headed for tiebreaks after a second, much less eventful draw.

The event again - like last year - took place on Chess.com rather than in Leon over the board. There was a slightly unusual schedule with the first semi-final match taking place a little early on Wednesday 30th, the second semi-final match took place on 3rd of July and the final on Sunday 4th. The two favourites met in the final where after trading wins in the four game rapid match Boris Gelfand won a second tie-break game against Leinier Dominguez Perez to win the event.

Meanwhile, Ding Liren bounced back from his loss in the first set by remarkably beating Magnus Carlsen 3-0 in their second mini-match.

But recently Black found new possibilities and the line became attractive again. In the new ChessBase Magazine #202, opening expert Rustam Kasimdzhanov shows the latest developments of this variation. The French expert uses the game Alekseenko-Grischuk from the Candidates Tournament 2020/2021 as a starting point. Take a look at an excerpt of his video analysis!",

By contrast the King's Gambit ran to 105 pages in the same book, which shows the level of interest analysts had at the time. Nonetheless, in the period between 1847 and 1895 it did get used occasionally, most memorably in the following game between Steinitz and Anderssen. What is strange about this game (which has quite a modern look about it), is that it took",
