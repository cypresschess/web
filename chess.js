While the Schliemann in and of itself isn't that bad, there are some pretty dubious lines, especially now with chess engines ruining most gambits. I ventured the Mohring variation, which is known to be poor as long ago as the early 1980's, hoping my opponent might miss the best line. When he played 12 moves of theory I began to (a) regret my decision to choose this line and (b) try and remember what I used to know 35 years ago. Luckily he missed the the correct defensive move (13.d4!) and after that his position collapsed very quickly. <br /> <b>Cunningham,Cam - Press,Shaun [C63]</b><br />Belconnen Cup, 24.05.2022 <s",

While Taimanov didn't win the training matches he felt it helped him, that was until he lost 6-0. So my question is - If you add either the ability to reference books, or be allowed to move pieces while analysing, how much stronger would you be? 100 points, 200 points or more ",

It seemed to be a pretty big deal in Thailand, and probably in other countries as well. One sport that is part of the program (and is a full medal sport) is Chess. Medals are being awarded for standard chess, as well as rapidplay and blitz, for both Men and Women (I'm assuming that there is no Open section). Although both events are small, they are very strong, with every participant holding a title.

However the quality of play was quite high in most of the games, although the GM technique of picking up small pieces of material at regular intervals was on full display. While every player survived the first hour, and most reached 20 moves, it was in the middlegame where most players came undone.
