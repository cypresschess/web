Alexander Grischuk took advantage of a mistake by Constantin Lupulescu while they were still in theory. Shakhriyar Mamedyarov beat Levon Aronian in a pretty well known line where Aronian went wrong pretty fast after Mamedyarov's novelty. The third leader going into the round was Wesley So, his advantage was not quite enough for a win against Anish Giri. Grischuk beat Lupulescu in a Sicilian Richter-Rauser. 17...Bb5? led to a win for black in the game Stefansson-Filipenko from 2001 but 18.Qe1! (instead of 18.Be2 which is about equal) led to a significant advantage for white and he brought home the full point",

It's always nice to see strong events have places and opportunities for local players, sometimes that's not a priority which is often a shame. In particular Bogdan-Daniel Deac seems ready to grab this opportunity with both hands. Fabiano Caruana won fairly easily as white against Constantin Lupulescu. The game was a sharp French Defence with castling on opposite wings. The key moment seems to have been 17...Ba4? which allowed Caruana to win a clean pawn and take the Queens off. 17....e5 seems to have been the correct test of white's setup - 18. h5 exd4 19. hxg6 Qg5 20.
