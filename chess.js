Sometimes they legitimately disappear, but in some case, they are \"lost\" because looking at them is somewhat painful. As an example, the scoresheet for the game below was \"lost\" for a number of days. Having collected an undeserved point*, and generally unhappy with the course of the game, I couldn't locate the scoresheet the next day. To be honest, I didn't look terribly hard for it either, and assumed it had gone out with the rubbish. In fact it was where I normally put my scoresheets after a game (in my bag), but it took me a week to realise this. So here is a \"lost scoresheet\" game, with apologies to my opponent",

Fortunately there was quite a large collection of chess books on offer, so I didn't miss out on the bargains. Somewhat shamefully I did by a book on the London System, but I made up for it by grabbing a copy of the Jan Timman classic \"The Art of Chess Analysis\". At first I thought I already owned a copy but it turns out that it was a significant omission from my library. I did grab a few other titles, and also was interviewed by ABC Radio while browsing. As the Book Fair runs until Sunday I will probably make the effort to return towards the end, to see what remains. ",
