The superstar streamer was looking to secure qualification for the Candidates Tournament and needed a few rated games to do so. That set the stage for some wildly lopsided encounters - none more striking than his matchup against Nahum Jose Villamil, rated just 1933, nearly 1000 points below Hikaru. Against all odds, Villamil came close to pulling off what would have been one of the most sensational underdog upsets in chess history. Robert Ris has a closer look.",

Maxime Vachier-Lagrave outplayed Gukesh for a few moves in the middlegame but missed the final killer blow and the game finished in a draw. Wesley So was better almost throughout against Alireza Firouzja, 30...f5?! was definitely an inaccuracy and rather than agree to a repetition So should have played on with 32.Kd2 (or subsequently this deviation when they repeated). The games Levon Aronian against Jan-Krzysztof Duda and Praggnanandhaa against Sam Sevian were quiet draws. Round 5 pairings: Duda-Gukesh, Caruana-So, Sevian-",
