In spite of playing the late Titled Tuesday (and losing three games) he managed an impressive win. Today he found a very smart way to cause Parham Maghsoodloo problems and eventually outplayed his opponent. Afterwards Carlsen said he was happy to give himself a decent chance of a good tournament result, but pointed out that to win the tournament he is going to have to rely on others. Definitely back in contention though. The leading fixture of the day Wesley So against Anish Giri never really caught fire and was drawn in 34 moves. Nodirbek Abdusattorov played it very safe today against Ding ",
