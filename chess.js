This option has been one of the most common choices in high level chance for a long time now, it's solid and black can research deeply. Nepomniachtchi chose 4.d3 and Ding's preparation seemed to run quite deep. 15....Qc7 was a very interesting idea but Ding did not follow it up correctly, 17...Rb8?! whilst not horrible is the move that started to cause difficulties, the pawn sacrifice 17...Bf8 was best (it's so sound it's even doubtful ",

I had purchased them the day before, but the credit card transaction had not been completed before I left the store. Realising my crime, I returned today to settle accounts. I described my purchases to a different manager than yesterday's, as \"chess and gardening books\". She immediately asked me if I had watched the previous nights game, referring to the current World Championship match. I said that I not, but was aware that Ding had failed to convert a promising position. \"Yes, he missed a few chances\" was her considered reply.<br /> ",

Off the board it seems that people have found some of Ding's training games on Lichess where these unusual lines, and presumably other things he intends to use were practiced. Ding played 4.e3 against the Nimzo-Indian but only on the way to a Saemisch pawn structure with 5.a3, he then played 9.Ra2 which he believed would be a powerful surprise. Nepomniachtchi didn't take long over choosing 9...b6 which would be most people's first idea in this structure. Ding followed up with a very temporary piece sacrifice and then a break in the centre. 17.d6",
