In tonight's ACT Online Rapid there was a very interesting K+P ending, which both players found some very good moves, and some not so great ones. Given the time control (10m+2s) it is unfair to criticise the missed wins (and draws), but I have highlighted them anyway, to show the turning points in the game. Of particular interest is the last variation, which shows how K+Q v K+Q isn't always an automatic draw. <br /> <b>RapanasCorner - chesslh [D53]</b><br />https://lichess.org/pVb9REtO <script>new PgnViewer( { boardName: \"game1269\", movesFormat: \"default\", pgnString:'1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3",
