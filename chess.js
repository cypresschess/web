Giri beat Gukesh by showing the power of a small initiative with bishops of opposite colour even in a very simplified position. Gukesh fought hard but could not survive. World Champion Ding Liren was beaten in a theoretical duel by Praggnanandhaa who slowly outplayed him. Wei Yi exploited a bad error after first time control by Parham Maghsoodloo to win. Alexander Donchenko was winning against Ian Nepomniachtchi but failed to convert in the end and the game was drawn as was Alireza Firouzja against Nodirbek Abdusattorov, Jorden van Foreest aga",
