With a lot at stake all the games (with the exception of Aronian - Dubov) were fought to the bitter end. The ceremonial first move was executed by Richard Lutz, CEO of Deutsche Bahn (German Railways). Mr. Lutz is a strong player himself and Deutsche Bahn has been a regular supporter of chess in Germany over the years. He opened the game for Vidit with 1.c4 against local player Vincent Keymer and the games were on! <div class=\"e2-text-picture\"> <img src=\"https://worldchess.com/news/pictures/20220210150126_IMG_1500-1.jpg\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" alt=\"\" /> <div",

In 1976, after Kortschnoi had fled the USSR, Gulko refused to sign a critical statement against Kortschnoi, and as a result Gulko was targeted by the authorities. For seven years, Gulko fought to emigrate from the Soviet Union, and in 1986 he moved to the USA, where he continued his chess career.
