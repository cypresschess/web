In the Early Niemann beat Carlsen and Nakamura in successive rounds (although neither game is a classic) to set up his win. Niemann finished on 10.5/11 with a final round draw against Klementy Sychev, Magnus Carlsen was clear second on 10 points. In the Late event Carlsen won with 10/11, his only loss coming to Hikaru Nakamura, however his win against Niemann in round 10 came from a game where he was completely busted for much of the time.

The centrepiece of the event was his second game with India's world champion, Gukesh Dommaraju, in which Carlsen banged the table in frustrated rage when his winning position slipped away.
