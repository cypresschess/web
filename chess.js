Sometimes they legitimately disappear, but in some case, they are \"lost\" because looking at them is somewhat painful. As an example, the scoresheet for the game below was \"lost\" for a number of days. Having collected an undeserved point*, and generally unhappy with the course of the game, I couldn't locate the scoresheet the next day. To be honest, I didn't look terribly hard for it either, and assumed it had gone out with the rubbish. In fact it was where I normally put my scoresheets after a game (in my bag), but it took me a week to realise this. So here is a \"lost scoresheet\" game, with apologies to my opponent",
