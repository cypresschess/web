Having started seriously following cricket from 1974 onwards, I spent most of the first 20 years watching Australia get soundly beaten by the West Indies (1975-76 being the exception). From the late 90's onwards this flipped, with Australia being the dominate team, but as someone who thought Australia ay never win a series against the West Indies, I'm OK with todays result. Well done to the West Indies for a well deserved victory. ",

The rather terse entry simply says \"For services to chess\", although it is certainly for more than that. Roy has been a long term organiser in Canberra, particularly with the Canberra Chess Club. When the club was in a bit of a slump, he took on the management role at the club, rebuilding it up to it's former glory. He has also served on the ACT Chess Association Committee for a number of years, assisting the ACTCA in organising various events in the nations capital. I believe Roy is the first local player/organiser to be recognised for work in chess, and it is a well deserv",

In the world of chess there is also the concept of the Morphy number, where you trace the number of steps back to Paul Morphy, through a chain of opponents. Surprisingly, my Morphy number seems higher than either my Erdos or Bacon numbers, although the distance in time may account for this. My Erdos number is 4, having collaborated on a paper with someone whose Erdos number was 3. My Bacon number (probably 4) is somewhat tenuous, as I worked on an amateur fil",

The latter result meant that Anish Giri extended his lead in the tournament to a point. Giri was under some pressure by Praggnanandhaa but this was gone by first time control. In the remaining games Vidit drew with Max Warmerdam, Alexander Donchenko drew with Jorden Van Foreest, Nodirbek Abdusattorov drew with Wei Yi and Parham Maghsoodloo drew with Ding Liren. 6 out of 7 games in the Challengers were decisive leaving Erwin L'Ami in the lead on 4/5. Eline Roebers beat joint leader Hans Moke Niemann to get off the mark. Round 5 Standings: 1st Gir",
