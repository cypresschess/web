At this stage this is a non official request (ie not in my role as Secretary of the FIDE Qualification System) but it may turn out to lead into a more formal review. One of the main comments I do hear is about the number of (W)GM's/(W)IM's/(W)FM's currently going around, especially compared the the historical origins of the titles. On the other hand, I don't see players who are close to the title hoping that the process is made harder. One suggestion made to me today was to simply increase the peak rating required to earn a title (ie 2600 instead of 2500 for a GM)",
