Carlsen had an extra pawn in a major piece endgame but the engines stubbornly evaluated the position as more or less equal. Carlsen said he predicted Erigaisi's mistake, 30...Re6?, which quickly allowed Carlsen to obtain a winning endgame. Instead Carlsen's suggestion of 30...Qe7 or the computer's 30...h5 would have likely led to a draw. Even Carlsen's win would not have been enough to lead had Fabiano Caruana converted his long term big advantage against World Champion Gukesh. The moment was 48.Qf4? from G",
