Winning his last round, he caught the 2 leaders (who drew on the top board) with an impressive score of 8/10. This result, combined with his Olympiad result will see him add around 40 points to his current rating, pushing him to around 2580. Faced with a must win game in the final round, he found a long term piece sacrifice which kept his opponent under pressure, and then finished the game off with a mating attack. <b>Cheng,Bobby (2540) - Terry,Renato (2507) [A55]</b><br />23rd Sants Open chess24.com (10.3), 28.08.2022 <script>new PgnViewer( { board",
