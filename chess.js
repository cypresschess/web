Nepo played a line in the Petroff where Black sacrifices a rook, but draws by perpetual check soon afterwards. However Rapport rejected the first repetition, although this simply forced Nepo to aim for another repetition a few moves later. However, when Rapport avoided the second repetition, he ended up losing his queen for insufficient compensation, with a loss to show for his trouble. After the game Rapport suggested it was the result of poor preparation, although this move he played was already known to be bad. But not only did this game effect Nepo's standings, it also had an effect on Caruan",
