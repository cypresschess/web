Quick draws in the games Richard Rapport vs Anish Giri very quickly followed by Shakhriyar Mamedyarov against Fabiano Caruana meant that intrigue over the top four was over too. The remaining four games however were all full of interest and white won three and there was a wild draw in the fourth. Sergey Karjakin said he was extremely upset about his loss to Sam Shankland in Round 12 and implied he might easily have taken a quick draw under the right circumstances. ",

This was due to fact that Dubov had to leave the tournament early, having tested positive to Covid 3 rounds before the end. While this could be considered a bit of bad luck for Dubov, it should be noted that he also defaulted his game against Giri after being required to wear a mask due to a positive test of a close contact. In the end Carlsen finished on 9.5/13 (+6=7-0) including wins against players who finished just behind him in the standings.

Caruana played a Rossolimo Sicilian with white but didn't get much and the game was equal after 19.Qa3 (19.c4!?) then after 26.f3 Caruana allowed the strong exchange sacrifice ",

Of interest though is how some of the lower seeded players might do.
