         "description" : " In the lead up to his match against Bobby Fischer, Mark Taimanov played a training match against a couple of Soviet GM's. To make the match harder for Tamainov, his opponents were allowed to consult with books (no engines in those days), or move the pieces on the board while analysing (they had a separate board and room for this). While Taimanov didn't win the training matches he felt it helped him, that was until he lost 6-0. So my question is - If you add either the ability to reference books, or be allowed to move pieces while analysing, how much stronger would you be? 100 points, 200 points or more ",

If you don't find a better choice, then take the best option from your initial research. How does this apply to chess then?
