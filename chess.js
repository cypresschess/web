         "description" : "St. Petersburg 1914 is one of the most memorable tournaments in history. What has made it a landmark chess event? Was it because it was the first true super-tournament of the 20th century and chess' modern age? Was it because it drew together the legendary trio of Emanuel Lasker, Jose Raul Capablanca, and Alexander Alekhine for the first time? Was it because it provided one of the most dramatic and riveting finishes of all time in top-level chess? The reasons are plenty, all of which call for a revisit of the tournament a century and eight years after its passing.",
