Apart from some online participation in FIDE and Asian events, it has been pretty quiet. Signs of life are starting to appear though, with the decision to hold the 2023 Oceania in Melbourne in January 2023. Teams are starting to get themselves organised for the Olympiad, and there is also talk of a possible Oceania Juniors in 2022 (or 23), and an Oceania Seniors. Unlike almost all other FIDE zones, air travel is the key to the success of these events, so hopefully the opening of borders between the various countries will see renewed enthusiasm for these tournaments. <br /> ",

If you are not familiar with the concept, it is essentially allowing you to pay extra money to a free game, to receive benefits that other players do not get. It is a business model for some games, which while profitable, can annoy an existing user base. More so if the game starts out as 'free forever' before it isn't. In the past I played a few games like this, but as soon as they became 'p2w' I lost interest. But having said that, I do wonder what 'p2w' chess might look like. eg Buying takebacks, Rejecting your opponents first choice, two moves in a row, castling after moving your king Some of these are probably too drastic (Playin",

At the moment there are 20 places left in the Major (Under 2000 ACF), so if you wish to play the Major, you should get your entries in quick. At the moment there are over 200 entries for the event, and with 5 weeks before the event starts, a field well in excess of 300 is expected.

Almost all the games were still in the opening stage, and yet one game was already finished. At first I thought it was a forfeit, or even worse, a mobile phone default, but instead it was just a misplayed opening that was quickly punished. White didn't play any outright blunders (in the usual sense), but every move seemed to make the position worse. Realising that f2 was about fall, White decided that they had seen enough. <br /> <b>Pitl,Jarno (1988) - Wegerle,Joerg (2404) [A04]</b><br />Schachbundesliga chess24.com (2.8), 06.03.2022 <script>new PgnViewer( { boardName: \"game1315\", move",
