Caruana drew the first classical game with Black without any difficulties, but went nuts in his white game with 27.g5? Bxf1? 28.Rxf1?, leaving him with no real compensation for the sacrificed material. Happily for Team America, Jumabayev erred with 32...Nf6, and Caruana made it to the time control with equality. Alas, Caruana's 41st move was a blunder (or if you think that only obvious errors can be blunders, it was a big mistake). Jumabayev took his time, figured it out, and took advantage. This was not the only upset, however. Anish Gi",
