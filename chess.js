Game 11 was Nepo's last chance to turn it around (or at least get something from the experience) but another tactical oversight left Carlsen with a winning position. He duly converted to reach the 7.5 points needed to retain his title. The second half collapse wasn't so much due to Nepo losing game 6, but his failure to bounce back in games 7 or 8. If he had been able to hold game 8 (instead of losing it) he might have still had a chance. Instead the blunder in game 8 (dropping a cold pawn) was somewhat reminiscent of Spassky's",

There are incredible moments there, new chess ideas are introduced and new trends set. The 14-game event where each game takes up to 8 hours is also a bit of a sartorial exercise in which the players wear suits (yes, there is a dress code) and try to look the part. Magnus Carlsen, the defending World Champion, has mastered this task with his signature systematic approach. He has two sets of suits, for black and white pieces.

Nepomniachtchi continued to hammer away at Carlsen's solid Ruy Lopez and again he chose 8.a4 in response to which Carlsen repeated the move 8...Rb8 he played in game 5. 11.d3 was Nepomniachtchi's new try but after the game he implied that his team hadn't found much anywhere to test Rb8.
