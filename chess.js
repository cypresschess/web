As the series is set a long way into the future, it is a little surprising they went with chess, and not some invented game. The actual reference involves a 'castling device' which allows 2 bodies to swap positions, in almost the same way as a king and a rook can. It is employed by Hober Mallow, initially to pull of a robbery, and then eventually to cheat death. Note: the term \"hate-watching\" refers to watching a tv show or movie that you know is complete garbage, but you feel compelled to watch it any way.
