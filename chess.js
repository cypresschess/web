         "description" : "Vidit continues as the sole leader of the Tata Steel Masters on Wednesday's rest day after drawing against Andrey Esipenko in Round 4 while Magnus Carlsen missed a chance to beat Jorden van Foreest in a fantastic fight. The players moving up were Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, who came back from the dead to take down Jan-Krzysztof Duda, and 16-year-old Praggnanandhaa, who did what Magnus failed to do on his top group debut in 2007 and won a game, against Nils Grandelius. It was a good day for India as Arjun Erigaisi won a 3rd game in a row to take the sole lead in the Challengers.",

Of interest though is how some of the lower seeded players might do.
