The world champion's lead over So is now 7 points - almost insurmountable given that there is only a maximum of 9 points still to be earned. The tournament organizers might therefore soon proclaim Magnus Carlsen as the \"world's top online chess player\" as the potential winner of the tournament. | ",

After that it does get better, but we'd all be champions if you could ignore our losses! So for the moment I am cruising along at around 50%, but hopefully more practice will lead to more wins. ",
