Chess fans haven't seen this kind of rip-roaring action since Karpov, Andersson, and Ribli were perennial tournament favorites, and I hope they never will again. Congratulations to Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, whose three consecutive wins (which were also his only wins) in rounds 5-7 with draws in his remaining games secured clear first by a full point over the trailing troika of Levon Aronian, Wesley So, and Alexander Grischuk. Anish Giri and Teimour Radjabov came next, a further half a point back, both scoring 50%. Giri won one and lost one, but Radjabov was perfect in the event, drawing all nine game",
