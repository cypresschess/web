Another big result was the win by Austria over Germany 2.5-1.5, resulting in another top 10 team (on seedings) drop down the table. Both Australian teams played well against tough opposition. The open team narrowly lost 1.5-2.5 to Poland, with a win by Temur Kuybokarov the highlight. The Women's team did a little better, drawing 2-2 with Cuba, and now face the USA team ",

But the secret to this wasn't that the time control suited me, or that I was in good form, but something simpler. I turned up for all 6 rounds (3 weeks), which gave me a distinct advantage. A couple of close rivals had enforced absences (covid), while some had other commitments get in the way. Fortunately I wasn't affected by these issues, which maximised my winning chances! <br /> <b>Press,Shaun - Grcic,Milan [D02]</b><br />Gungahlin Rapid (6), 19.07.2022 <script>new PgnViewer( { boardName: \"game1338\", movesFormat: \"default\", pgnString:'1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.g3 c5 4.Bg2 cxd4 5.O-O Nc6 6.Nxd4 e5 7.Nxc6 b",

This was because my father had a copy of the Gligoric book on the match, and it was probably the first chess book that I read, albeit 4 years after the match was played. I still flick through the book (and a number of others about the match), revisiting the analysis. One game that was particularly interesting was the 5th game of the match. It was notable for a provocative knight move on 11, which allowed Spassky to double Black's pawns. However a few moves later, Spassky was forced to undo",
