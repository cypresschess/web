Vladimir Kramnik has been proposing various chess variants over the last few years, and he'll put it to the test against the greatest player from the land where chess (probably) started (India) - his great rival Viswanathan Anand. They'll play a four-game match in Dortmund starting July 14; let's hope it's a good one. More <a ",

But both lost today, both in the second mini-match and in their subsequent tiebreaks. The latter match was more competitive, but for Carlsen it was as if he left his mind asleep in bed. Aronian won games 1 and 4 of the second mini-match (the other games were drawn), and then won both of the blitz games in the tiebreak to advance. (How many times has Carlsen scored just 1 out of 6 in professional competition?) The final between the \"Ar\"s starts tomorrow.",

Viktor Korchnoi's prickliness is acknowledged by all, and it does not ignore the fact that he abandoned his family. And while Anatoly Karpov is portrayed as opportunistically accepting every advantage that his Soviet supporters could bestow on him, he is presented with humanity, and he is one of the major participants in the doc",

It turned out that the win depended on both features being present, with the lack of king safety allowing tactics that assisted pawn promotion. <br /> <b>Press,Shaun - Brown,Jordan [E11]",

Possibly the changes have encouraged Magnus Carlsen to play this year, although a number of players in the top 20 are missing, although the cause is likely to be connected to travel difficulties. Such difficulties resulted in the top 3 qualifiers from the Oceania Zonal pulling out, and our spot now goes to CM Elmer Prudente from Guam.
