And by that I mean proper Mate in 2 problems, rather than easy tactics which result in a fairly obvious checkmate after 2 moves. While lots of players find such problems weird, they serve as an excellent training tool. Accurately calculating the first 3 moves of any sequence of moves reduces your chances of making a blunder significantly. And if you can spot the likely move quickly, then how you sort your candidate moves will also improve. But as the title says, finding an online (rather than a printed) source is proving difficult.

Unfortunately this simply meant he had to move the piece, and could not then make a claim, as it was his opponents move.

         "description" : " The 2nd day of the 2022 ACT Championship was a lot tougher for the top seeds, with not everyone escaping unscathed. 2nd seed Junta Ikeda drew his third round game with Willis Lo, while 4th seed Fred Litchfield had a similar result in round 2 against James Phan. On the other hand IM Rishi Sardana reached 3 from 3 with a win over Harry Press in the afternoon round, joined by Cameron McGowan and Michael Kethro. Kethro showed good technique to convert a rook and pawn ending against CM Hui Li, from a position he thought might have been drawn. With 8 players within half a point of each other at the top, it is too early to pick a likely winner. McGowan and Sardana are on the top board for tomorrow",
