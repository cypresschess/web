A decade and a half or so ago I wrote at least one post ruminating over whether chess should be considered a sport at all, and concluded (I think) that it was at least very sport-like. (If one thinks that a sport must have an athletic component, chess isn't a sport; if it's not necessary, then it is.) Going further, if one thinks that Olympic sports ought to have some plausible connection with what the ancient Greeks and Romans did, then the idea that chess should be an Olympic sport is ludicrous - but then so is figure skating, rhythmic gymnastics, and curling.
