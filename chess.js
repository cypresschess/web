         "description" : "Ex-World Championship challengers Ian Nepomniachtchi and Fabiano Caruana got off to a perfect start in a blistering Round 1 of the FIDE Candidates Tournament in Madrid. Nepo overwhelmed top seed Ding Liren, while Fabi punished Hikaru Nakamura for castling into trouble. The remaining games were drawn, but only after huge fights. Jan-Krzysztof Duda was almost winning in 10 moves against Richard Rapport, while Alireza Firouzja lived dangerously against Teimour Radjabov.",

         "description" : " One form of chess that seems to still exists mainly on paper rather than online is the Mate in 2 (or more) problems. And by that I mean proper Mate in 2 problems, rather than easy tactics which result in a fairly obvious checkmate after 2 moves. While lots of players find such problems weird, they serve as an excellent training tool. Accurately calculating the first 3 moves of any sequence of moves reduces your chances of making a blunder significantly. And if you can spot the likely move quickly, then how you sort your candidate moves will also improve. But as the title says, finding an online (rather than a printed) source is proving difficult. Suggestions accepted with thanks. ",
