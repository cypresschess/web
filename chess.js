But the secret to this wasn't that the time control suited me, or that I was in good form, but something simpler. I turned up for all 6 rounds (3 weeks), which gave me a distinct advantage. A couple of close rivals had enforced absences (covid), while some had other commitments get in the way.

While I was only 5 years old when it happened, in a way it was still my first exposure to serious competitive chess. This was because my father had a copy of the Gligoric book on the match, and it was probably the first chess book that I read, albeit 4 years after the match was played. I still flick through the book (and a number of others about the match), revisiting the analysis. One game that was particularly interesting was the 5th game of the match. It was notable for a provocative knight move on 11, which allowed Spassky to double Black's pawns. However a few moves later, Spassky was forced to undo",
