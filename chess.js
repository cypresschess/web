Magnus Carlsen (open) and Hou Yifan (women) continue to occupy the top positions. However, a number of prominent players lost a lot of points and thus also dropped down the rankings in the most recent open tournaments in Dubai and Sharjah.

The most common explanation is a combination of recent poor health, and the psychological letdown after winning the World Championship. This may be so, but then again ... When I played him in 2019, he had just flown in from St Louis, where he had beaten Magnus Carlsen in a playoff to win the 2019 Sinquefield Cup. He was clearly unwell when he played me, and at one point I was convinced he was going to fall asleep at the board. Nonetheless, he went all the way through the tournament, only losing in the Final.
