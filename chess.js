Nepomniachtchi had the better side of the draw but the margin of error for Caruana was very high and the game was drawn in 40 moves. As things stand three draws will very likely be enough for Nepomniachtchi to become Magnus Carlsen's challenger. Anish Giri moved within half a point of the lead with a win over Ding Liren but he has already lost the mini-match against the leader 1.5-0.5 and that's the first tie-break.
