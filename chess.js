         "description" : " The LFG Round Robin has finished with a comprehensive victory for Harry Press. The event was organised by IA Lee Forace and involved a number of the higher rated Canberra players. In the end it was a tournament that saw the top players dominate the lower rated players (including myself). Harry Press finished on 8.5/9, conceding a single draw to Wenlin Yin. Ties for 2nd were FM Fred Litchfield and Fabrizio Magrini on 7. Yin finished in 4th place on 6.5. With such heaving scoring at the top (+22=2-0 against the bottom 6 players), it wasn't a surprise that no one else scored 50% . The best of these players was Sankeerten Badrinaryan who scored 4/9, with Malik Amer (3.5), FM Shaun Press (2.5), ",
