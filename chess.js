Praggnanandhaa drew a well conducted Open Spanish against Wei Yi where there weren't any clear chances for either player. In contrast Abdusattorov built up a winning position against World Champion Gukesh only to let it slip at the end. Gukesh remains very much in touch half a point behind the leaders.
