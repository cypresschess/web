She emphasizes the educational value of understanding pawn structures for overall middle-game improvement, using a Kasparov-Kramnik game as a case study. Svitlana explains typical plans for both sides: white often uses space advantage and looks for a queenside breakthrough with moves like b4 and c5, while black prepares central or queenside pawn breaks like d5 or b5, and, much to Arne's delight, may even launch a kingside attack with &hellip;g5.
