So one suggestion is that each developing federation receives funding for a program officer, whose job it is is to implement these programs. The ultimate goal is to create enough chess",

Usually, they put a lot of effort into positions that are approximately equal. However, once they get a much better or much worse position, they tend to relax a bit. In an almost winning position, a voice in the head of such a player whispers: \"You are great, my dear, and you have proved that already. The rest of the game is a mere formality.\" And in a lost position, this voice says: \"You have played rubbish. Ok, you have to pretend some fight, but the game is decided already, you will surely be defeated.\" Although psychologically understandable, this approach is wrong. Why? | Photo: Pixabay",
