And Black was not punished for playing Qb6, but was instead punished by White's Qb3.

If I stacked my books in a pile, it would be 74 feet high, at around 4% of my books aren't written by a person(!). Of the 200 identified authors, 48% are still alive, while 48% have died. 98% of my books are in English, although a number were originally written in other languages (mainly Russian). But probably the most surprising, and somewhat disappointing statistic is that only 1% of the authors in my collection were female. ",

Nakamura said he didn't see any upside to going into a battle with black today where even if he won he was unlikely to overhaul Nepomniachtchi. After other results today Nepomniachtchi now only needs a draw to confirm tournament victory, I rather doubt it will turn out he needs any more points at all. The only decisive result of the day was an almost complete catastrophe with the white pieces for Ding Liren against Teimou",
