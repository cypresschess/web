It was in the context of an early Qb6 against the Catalan, and the way I remembered it, Black was quickly punished for such a move. Turns out I was wrong about most things that I thought I had remembered. It wasn't a Catalan, but an English (albeit with a kingside fianchetto). And Black was not punished for playing Qb6, but was instead punished by White's Qb3. The only consolation was that I did get the names of the players right, and who the winner was. <br /> <b>Petrosian,Tigran V - Ree,Hans [A29]</b><br />Hoogovens Wijk aan Zee (12), 26.01.1971 <script>new PgnViewer( { b",

The Howick Chess Centre (in Howick!) is a joint effort by Paul Spiller and the NZCF, providing both a venue for regular chess activities, and as a NZCF Office for the storage of historical items, and as a shop for NZCF items. Recognising the economic reality of such a venture, the Centre will be running until at least July 2023, at which time a review in its operation will take place. A worthy initiative by Paul Spiller and the NZCF, and one I am sure many other chess federations would like to emulate. ",
