Of all the players in this group, 54th seed Weller is the most surprising (and possibly the most surprised!). An upset win over Mark Vliestra in the 4th round moved him show ring, where he faces IM James Morris in the 5th round. The Minor also sees three players on 4/4, Benny Chan, Lucas Lee and Jayden Arav.

There were a couple of no-shows (due to visa and travel issues), but the event got off to a very smooth start. The Open saw very few upsets, with the top 17 seeds all recording victories. There were four draws on lower boards, while lower rated players scored wins in four of the games. Round 2 sees some closer matchups on the top boards, although the rating gap is still around 500 points. In the Minor there were 6 upsets results, involving 5 wins and a draw. However a couple of these can be attributed to the variability in rating accuracy of new and lower rated players. J",

It was the final round of the Women's event, and so the commentators thought it was important to cover that, rather than the 2nd last round of the Open event. A sensible decision, especially as this was apparently the only round from the Women's event that was covered in full.<br />But the whinging in the comments section. It was full on. All the misogynistic stereotypes about women's chess were on full display, along with the smokescreen about wanting to see 'higher quality' chess. Given the level of comments by most of the people in this feed, the only criteria being used was 'men = higher quality' rather than any",

My main objection is obviously aesthetic, in that higher quality games are played at slower time limits, but the other is more practical. If the events are played online, new players will struggle to get a look in, Why? Because without an existing OTB track record, there will be an assumption that they are cheating. And if there is a decline in OTB events, where will they get this track record? Combine this with the fact that fast chess leads to more superficial styles of play, then even if they start with OTB blitz and rap",
