Last year Carlsen got off to a poor start losing the 5m+1spm portion 6.5-2.5 and although he pulled close Nakamura had the upper hand throughout and infamously ran down the clock at the end to ensure victory. This year felt much closer with only a point in it in all three sections. Carlsen won the initial 5m+1spm section 5-4, Nakamura won the 3m+1spm 5-4 but it was Carlsen who triumphed in the Bullet 4.5-3.5 to win by ",

However, with a enormous amount of chess now being played online, sudden ends to games have less to do with players overlooking threats, and more to do with misclicks and failed pre-moves. But even OTB games aren't immune to a version of this. Some blunders can only be explained by a player touching the wrong piece and being forced to play the losing move (well, that's the most charitable explanation I can think off).
