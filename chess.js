However instead of writing the move on the scoresheet, he picked up the piece to demonstrate the move he intended to play. Unfortunately this simply meant he had to move the piece, and could not then make a claim, as it was his opponents move. His opponent then avoided the repetition, but there were enough checks to reach (and indeed go past)",

I ventured the Mohring variation, which is known to be poor as long ago as the early 1980's, hoping my opponent might miss the best line. When he played 12 moves of theory I began to (a) regret my decision to choose this line and (b) try and remember what I used to know 35 years ago. Luckily he missed the the correct defensive move (13.d4!) and after that his position collapsed very quickly. <br /> <b>Cunningham,Cam - Press,Shaun [C63]</b><br />Belconnen Cup, 24.05.2022 <s",

While Taimanov didn't win the training matches he felt it helped him, that was until he lost 6-0. So my question is - If you add either the ability to reference books, or be allowed to move pieces while analysing, how much stronger would you be? 100 points, 200 points or more ",

Basically it suggests that you spend the first 37% of the time you take to make a decision to collect and collate information about the decision. Then when you come across an option that exceeds the best option you identified initially, you take that option and stop searching.
