There were 7 players from the ACT taking part, and for all of them, this was their first international event. The best performed players were Dev Raichura and Jerry Cheng, in the Under 8's section. Both scored 6/9 to finish towards the top of the standings. In the Under 12 section, Larry Cheng scored 4.5/9, and would have been joined by Minchen Yang and Charles Huang, if final round results had gone their way. The next event is the Asian Online Junior and is expected that some of the players who played this event will back up for that one. <br /> <b>Cheng,Jerry ",
