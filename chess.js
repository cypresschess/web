It is equally startling to think that there will be a whole generation of chess players who know nothing about Mark Dvoretsky, his work or his achievements. Fortunately there is a new book from New in Chess to remind the chess world about Mark Dvoretsky. CHESS Magazine review by Sean Marsh.",

Ju Wenjun, Lei Tingjie, Humpy Koneru, Anna Muzychuk, Rameshbabu Vaishali and Pia Cramling played in that. Magnus Carlsen won the event ahead of Hikaru Nakamura. If conventional scoring had been chosen they would have tied for first and different tie-breaks would have produced different winners (SB vs most wins say). Ju Wenjun beat rival Lei Tingjie on the final day to take clear first in the women's event. The",
