It is now consists of a single 10 player RR, rather than the mix of GM event, Open swisses, monster rapids, and other events. The GM event is strong as usual, with 4 English GM's against 6 visiting players. There are a couple of interesting inclusions, including Gukesh, who is trying to qualify for the 2024 Candidates, and Hans Neimann, on a hot streak after winning in Zagreb last week.
