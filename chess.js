Gukesh had the white pieces and the opening was a slow manoeuvring Ruy Lopez Berlin where Carlsen had equalised by move 17 and was at least a bit better by move 20. Gukesh kept playing slightly inferior moves 22.Bc6?! (Rc1) 23.Qc2?!, 24.Kh1?! (24.Ne2) and finally after 25.Qa2 (maybe 25.Kh2) he was lost and soon about to lose a piece. Maybe Carlsen's 36...Bxd5 wasn't the cleanest (36...Bxf3 or 36...Rh8 may have induced a quick resignation) but he was still clear",
