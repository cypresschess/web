         "description" : "In this entertaining and instructive video, WIM Svitlana Demchenko faced the \"Bobby Fischer\" engine from Fritz 20 in a dynamic training match. She played the Scotch Gambit and managed to gain a clear advantage through sharp tactical play, sacrificing material for initiative and space. Despite a midgame slip that dropped her evaluation and confidence, she regrouped and navigated a complex endgame with precision, ultimately securing the win. The game showcased both instructive mistakes and brilliant ideas, making it a realistic and valuable learning experience rather than a flawless engine battle.",
