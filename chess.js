First, chess is being played in Dortmund, with the two veterans Anand, and Kramnik, battling it out, without castling. Second, in the same city, the German Grand Prix takes place, with Pavel Eljanov in top form. Third, the World Cup in Sochi has unfortunate covid cases to deal with. Lawrence Trent also has an anecdote, why he had a hard time to play against a smelly chess opponent, and how he dealt with it.",

The event again - like last year - took place on Chess.com rather than in Leon over the board. There was a slightly unusual schedule with the first semi-final match taking place a little early on Wednesday 30th, the second semi-final match took place on 3rd of July and the final on Sunday 4th. The two favourites met in the final where after trading wins in the four game rapid match Boris Gelfand won a second tie-break game against Leinier Dominguez Perez to win the event.

This also happened in a few other games, with some players having travel difficulties, either covid related or not. Oceania representative CM Elmer Prudente lost is first game yesterday, and is in a bit of trouble today. Australian representative GM Bobby Cheng drew against his almost identically rated opponent yesterday, and todays game is still even as I type this. This match might be headed to tie-breaks.
