However, the pieces could be rotated, instead of moving, to enable them to move in entirely different directions. Although the game is out of print, it can be played at various online game platforms.

Apart from some online participation in FIDE and Asian events, it has been pretty quiet. Signs of life are starting to appear though, with the decision to hold the 2023 Oceania in Melbourne in January 2023. Teams are starting to get themselves organised for the Olympiad, and there is also talk of a possible Oceania Juniors in 2022 (or 23), and an Oceania Seniors. Unlike almost all other FIDE zones, air travel is the key to the success of these events, so hopefully the opening of borders between the various countries will see renewed enthusiasm for these tournaments. <br /> ",

         "description" : " The concept of 'pay to win' games has always offended me. If you are not familiar with the concept, it is essentially allowing you to pay extra money to a free game, to receive benefits that other players do not get.

It triggered a global chess boom, not least in Britain where for a brief period a galaxy of talent made England the No 2 chess nation behind the Soviet Union. Reykjavik has another tradition, its annual international open first staged in 1964 when the legendary Mikhail Tal outclassed the field with 12.5/13.
