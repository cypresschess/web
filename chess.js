Gukesh had the white pieces and went back to an old love, the Reti, and came up with a rare variation 7.Re1 which had been mostly played in blitz games. This presented Ding Liren with the problem of finding a correct setup, and whilst it must have been uncomfortable for him it doesn't seem to me he was in that much trouble until he missed the very accurate 23...c3. That's to brush over a lot of decisions that had to be taken to that point but his position started to deteriorate rather quickly after that. Gukesh then took Queens off and damaged Ding's Ki",
