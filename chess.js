Leinier had lost to Wesley in their classical game, and it was the same story in the other tiebreak. Richard Rapport lost to Radek Wojtaszek in the first round but bounced back to win the tiebreak and set up a semi-final clash against Hikaru Nakamura.

The remaining four games however were all full of interest and white won three and there was a wild draw in the fourth. Sergey Karjakin said he was extremely upset about his loss to Sam Shankland in Round 12 and implied he might easily have taken a quick draw under the right circumstances. ",

This was due to fact that Dubov had to leave the tournament early, having tested positive to Covid 3 rounds before the end. While this could be considered a bit of bad luck for Dubov, it should be noted that he also defaulted his game against Giri after being required to wear a mask due to a positive test of a close contact. In the end Carlsen finished on 9.5/13 (+6=7-0) including wins against players who finished just behind him in the standings. There had been talk of Carlsen breaking the 2900 rating mark before the event began, and if h",

Carlsen said he was very motivated today in his game against Fabiano Caruana who likewise was looking for a fight. This was Carlsen's final game of the tournament as he was due to play Daniil Dubov in the final round but who has tested positive for Covid-19. It not surprisingly seemed important to Carlsen that this tournament victory wasn't due to this default. Caruana played a Rossolimo Sicilian with white but didn't get much and the game was equal after 19.Qa3 (19.c4!?) then after 26.f3 Caruana allowed the strong exchange sacrifice ",
