I always have a special feeling about this tournament as it started the same year I was first reporting on chess on the internet.

Usually, they put a lot of effort into positions that are approximately equal. However, once they get a much better or much worse position, they tend to relax a bit. In an almost winning position, a voice in the head of such a player whispers: \"You are great, my dear, and you have proved that already. The rest of the game is a mere formality.\" And in a lost position, this voice says: \"You have played rubbish. Ok, you have to pretend some fight, but the game is decided already, you will surely be defeated.\" Although psychologically understandable, this approach is wrong. Why? | Photo: Pixabay",

These days chess platforms have realised that such broadcasts can help bring users in, and have started offering it as a free service. Chess24 were probably the pioneers here, but other platforms are catching up. Both chess.com and lichess contacted me to stream the O2C Doeberl Cup this year, while 'Follow chess' normally carries it as well. If you are an organiser looking to use these services, each platform normally has instructions to follow (eg <a href=\"https://www.chess.com/article/view/how-to-broadcast-your-games-on-chesscom\">https://www.chess.com/article/view/how-to-broadcast-your-games-on-chesscom</a> f",

One of the more recent comments (made in person), was that I include lots of 'obscure club games'. While these are normally my own games, I do feature games by other club players (if I can grab the scoresheets). This time however, it is one of my recent games that I will feature. The takeaway from this game is twofold. A missed tempo on the opening can lead to a space disadvantage in the middlegame. This then leads to problems defending an unsafe king. <br /> <b>Press,Shaun - Mildenhall,Stephen [A30]</b><br />Murphy Memorial, 12.04.2022 <script>new PgnViewer( { boardName: \"game1322\", movesFormat: \"defaul",

Based on the shot of the board I think the game they played was composed by Sam Loyd, and is in fact the shortest game that ends in stalemate.
