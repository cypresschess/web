The good news for the organisers is that there will be 140 players in attendance (actually the maximum allowed). The bad news for spectators/parents is that this is close to the venue capacity, so only 'essential' staff are allowed in the playing area.

Term 1 saw one of Girl's zones held, while the open Primary School zones are about to commence for term 2. The North Canberra/ Gungahalin zone is running this Tuesday, and it looks like around 100 players will take part. Over the following weeks 2 other zones are being held, while Term 3 will see the Secondary events taking place. One thing that is slightly concerning is that not all the event information is getting passed on to the school's chess player. So if you are a junior player in Canberra, and you haven't heard about the upcoming events, head over to <a href=\"https://actjcl.org.au/act",

The tournament, filmed is a special pavilion, was different from typical chess events - it was visually engaging, lightning-fast, and featured novelties like heart beat metrics. The event was a prime-time hit. The series will resume next year, and we are happy to give you the insider view of the first time Vladimir Kramnik, one of the participants of the series, visited the playing arena. <div class=\"e2-text-video\"> <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3_mX7jIu_DU?enablejsapi=1\" allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"",

         "description" : " Magnus Carlsen won the FTX Crypto Chess Cup beating Wesley So in an Armageddon tie-break. This win means that Carlsen will appear in the Meltwater tour final in September, although with his lead in the standings this seemed very likely anyway his victory in this last major means that he's already there by right. Carlsen struggled with his form throughout the tournament, he almost didn't make it to the knockout phase. On the final day he took the lead winning the first game playing powerfully to exploit some only slightly misplaced pieces. In game two Carlsen almost certainly mixed something up in his opening preparation, and in a sharp Sicilian this proved to be enough for So to win extreme",
