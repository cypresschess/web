I would say he was clearly winning by move 18, but more so, was completely winning at move 24. I suspect Aronian new he was winning, and Keymer probably knew he was completely lost. Probably the only strong players who may have underestimated Aronian's advantage would have been various chess engines, who gave Aronian a pawn advantage at best.
