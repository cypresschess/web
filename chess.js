The 2023 edition begins today in Italy, with 300 players across 3 sections (50+, 65+ and Women's 50+). Each event is headed by a GM, with Michael Adams the top seed in the 50+, John Nunn in the 65+ and Nona Gaprindashvili in the Women's. Australia only has one representative (Aurel John-Buciu) but New Zealand has 7. There are also 27 GM's playing across the event, with 16 in the 50+ Due to the timezone difference I don't think the frst round has started just yet, but you should be able to keep up with the tournament at <a href=\"https://www.worldseniorchess2023.com\">https://www.worldseniorchess2023.com</a> ",

The selected teams are Gold Creek (Girls Primary), Majura (Open Primary), Lyneham (Girls Secondary), Radford (Open Secondary). The competition was hard fought across the weekend, although each event finished with a clear winner. What I did find most interesting was that almost every player had an ACF Rating ID, which shows that players are transitioning from school only chess, to club and weekend chess. That this has not previously been true is one of the things that has been noticeable with ACT teams in recent years",
