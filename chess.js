Abdusattorov hasn't won a game since Giri beat him in Round 8 but no-one has caught him yet, today there was a draw against Vladimir Fedoseev where both players enjoyed the advantage at one stage or another. Discussion today has centred around why there have been so many errors with both Keymer and Gukesh talking about it. A combination of the youth and ambition of the field combined with the first time control with no increment has probably contributed. In second place Jorden Van Foreest and Javokhir Sindarov played each other and drew a well played game, they're now joined by Matthias Blu",

However there is now more of a chasing pack on 5.5pts following wins for Yagiz Kaan Erdogmus over Thai Dai Van Nguyen and Jorden Van Foreest who absolutely crushed Vincent Keymer in a sharp London System. The travails of Gukesh continue when he was thoroughly outplayed by Matthias Bluebaum who is now a point off the lead alongside Hans Moke Niemann who now hasn't won since round 4. The final game to finish saw Praggnanandhaa beat Chithambaram Aravindh in a major piece endgame that seems to me likely to be worth studying. Round 9 Standings: 1st Abdusattoro",
