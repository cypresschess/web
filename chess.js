Having been instructed to look for checks and captures, being asked to now look to 'capture squares' can be confusing. In some instances such advice will be ignored, but in other cases, it can lead to over thinking, where more substantial targets are ignored. In trying to locate a good example, I cam across this very fine game by Botvinnik against Donner. Occupying c6 with a knight is clearly the goal, but fortunately, it creates enough direct threats that the concept of 'good pieces lead to good tactics' is also easy to show. <br /> <b>Botvinnik,Mikhail - Donner,Jan Hein [A14]</b><br />",

This has resulted in more online events (which I don't really follow), and faster/shorter events, which I don't take that seriously. The other reason is that paradoxically, having more free time (due to retirement) has resulted in me having less free time.

The knock-on effect is that instead of chess being an alternative to work, it is just part of my work. On the bright side, I finally knocked off all the possible ",
