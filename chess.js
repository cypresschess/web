Almost all the games were still in the opening stage, and yet one game was already finished. At first I thought it was a forfeit, or even worse, a mobile phone default, but instead it was just a misplayed opening that was quickly punished. White didn't play any outright blunders (in the usual sense), but every move seemed to make the position worse. Realising that f2 was about fall, White decided that they had seen enough. <br /> <b>Pitl,Jarno (1988) - Wegerle,Joerg (2404) [A04]</b><br />Schachbundesliga chess24.com (2.8), 06.03.2022 <script>new PgnViewer( { boardName: \"game1315\", move",

At this stage it appears India have submitted a bid, but there is still a few days left for other federations to bid. I have heard (third hand I think), that at least 2 European federations are considering bids, while a suggested Middle East bid may not be feasible due to the short notice.
