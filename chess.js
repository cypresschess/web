I had calculated that I was better up until around move 14, and when I reached that point, realised I had a pretty quick checkmate, which my opponent kindly let me play on the board. <br />",

Gukesh, Giri and Firouzja lead on 5/8 but 6 more players are a point or less from the leaders with five rounds to go. Nepomniachtchi inflicted a broken pawn structure on Abdusattorov and whilst this wasn't immediately winning Abdusattorov didn't find a way to organise his pieces and he was soon just lost. Alireza Firouzja beat Ding Liren when the latter miscalculated a tactical sequence and lost material for no compensation. The remaining game were drawn, those were Vidit-Donchenko, Warmerdam-Praggnanandhaa, Ju Wenjun, Giri",
