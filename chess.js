         "description" : " The FIDE Candidates in Toronto, Canada are almost at the half way stage. Not much has been settled and 6 of the 8 players can still regard themselves as still being in the hunt for tournament victory. Today Ian Nepomniachtchi chose a drawish variation against Fabiano Caruana and whilst the American had to be accurate a draw was what we got. Nepomniachtchi said most of his preparation was focussed on the Sicilian but also such easy days are a key part of tournament strategy. How this draw will be seen will very much depend on the final result, wasted white against a major rival? Good pragmatic decision on the way to the title? We'll see. Gukesh did try against Hikaru Nakamura, his problem wa",

He is on 3/4 half a point clear of Fabiano Caruana and Gukesh. Can Nepomniachtchi win the Candidates for a third time in a row? Already I personally wouldn't bet against it, his fault of being a bit casual sometimes is infinitely better than being too tense, a problem that I sense Santosh Vidit has. Nepomniachtchi came with a new idea of 12.Nh2 against Vidit's Berlin, Vidit was doing fine until 26...Rb3?!

The remaining games were drawn, Goryachkina-Lagno was a Sicilian where the spectacular 17.Nf5 was probably a mistake, but it was all still a bit difficult and the game was equal a few moves later.

Consequently there were a few upsets in the first round, and even into the second. Defending champion GM Hrant Melkumyan started the tournament with 2 straightforward wins (including one over Harry Press). 2nd seed Mitrabha Guhu found round 2 a lot tougher, salvaging a draw against FM Michael Steadmen (NZ) from a position where he was a lot worse.
