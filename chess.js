Nodirbek Abdusattorov let a win escape against Vincent Keymer but stays very much in contention on 7.5 points as well. The leaders now all face players in the bottom half of the field, one of those players is however Arjun Erigaisi who faces two of them and may try to salvage something from an otherwise terrible event by winning these key games. World Champion Gukesh was held to a draw by Wei Yi. The Chinese player felt he was under pressure for much of the game although the engines didn't",
