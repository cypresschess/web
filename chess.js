This was a rapid Fischer Random (Chess960 or 9LX as styled here) tournament and is the last event Kasparov regularly plays in. Kasparov had a decent plus score in 2021 to a terrible 0.5/9 in 2022 and the only slightly better 3/9 last year so the challenge was on for him. Fabiano Caruana took clear first place with 7.5/9 half a point clear of Hikaru Nakamura with Wesley So in 3rd on 5.5 points. Kasparov finished on 50% with a very respect",
