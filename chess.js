         "description" : " One form of chess that seems to still exists mainly on paper rather than online is the Mate in 2 (or more) problems. And by that I mean proper Mate in 2 problems, rather than easy tactics which result in a fairly obvious checkmate after 2 moves. While lots of players find such problems weird, they serve as an excellent training tool. Accurately calculating the first 3 moves of any sequence of moves reduces your chances of making a blunder significantly. And if you can spot the likely move quickly, then how you sort your candidate moves will also improve. But as the title says, finding an online (rather than a printed) source is proving difficult.

Lawrence Trent played in the very same tournament, and reached the 50% mark, with 4.5 out of 9. Their game ended in a draw. Since Leon was still in Hamburg, we managed to have a Trent's Tactics show together. Maybe Lawrence, and Arne, thanks to Leon, finally went beyond the ChessBase tactics training rating of 2500?
