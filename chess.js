After the incident went viral, Yakubboev issued an apology, explaining his actions and expressing respect. He later informed other players of his beliefs to avoid misunderstandings.",

The winner of this year's Masters will surely be one of these players. Today the leaders Praggnanandhaa and Gukesh drew a Berlin Ruy Lopez in 33 moves. A game not without interest but also not that thrilling either. Fabiano Caruana beat Vincent Keymer on the black side of an Exchange Queen's Gambit. Caruana had a chance after 27.Bc1? but played 27...Qe7 instead of 27...Nd6! Caruana had to wait for another mistak",

Vincent Keymer beat Luke Leon Mendonca from a bad position after he made an error after forgetting his preparation in the Two Knights Defence. After that Mendonca started to drift, first of all not playing the most incisive winning try (26.c6), then he allowed Keymer right back in the game (28.h3) and then blundered his position away in one move (31.Rc1?).
