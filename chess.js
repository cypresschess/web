While this could be considered a bit of bad luck for Dubov, it should be noted that he also defaulted his game against Giri after being required to wear a mask due to a positive test of a close contact.

Dubov played his full part in the excitement and over the board Vidit thought he must have been lost at one stage - but this assessment was probably incorrect as he found a lot of forced moves. Half a point behind there is a big group of players on two points, Both Magnus Carlsen and Jan-Krzysztof Duda after their draw, Andrey Esipenko after beating Sergey Karjakin, Richard Rapport after beating Nils Grandelius in a wild Sicilian and finally Jorden van Foreest who managed to inflict a nightmare pawn structure in an endgame against R Praggnanandhaa.

As with most editions of the tournament, the organisers haven't packed it with just the top players in the world, although a tournament with Caruana, Giri and Mamedyarov is pretty strong. Even 10th seed Esipenko can be pretty dangerous (as Carlsen knows), although if it isn't Carlsen, then it is only someone else from the top 4 that I can see winning it. Of interest though is how some of the lower seeded players might do.
