Most pundits have Ju as the favourite for this match, based on match experience. The first game was a Ruy Lopez Berlin variation, although it wasn't as drawish as the opening may indicate. In fact White sacrificed a pawn in the opening, but regained it with a better position. However, Jun was able to reach a rook and pawn ending, and by that stage it was definitely drawn. <br /> <br /> <b>Lei Tingjie (2554) - Ju Wenjun (2566) [C67]</b><br /> FIDE WOMEN'S WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH 20 SHANG HAI, China (1.1), 05.07.2023 <script> new Pgn",
