Even with this year not being an Olympiad 'year' it does make sense to organise such an event, as this may become the norm post-covid anyway. It will run from the 13th August to the 15th September and will use the same format as last year. Each division will be a mix of seeded teams plus teams that qualified from the lower division. The top 8 teams from Division 1 will then play a KO final to determine a winner (or winners!). The tournament will be hosted on chess.com. Further details can be found at https://www.fide.com/news/1206 (** I will be a paid official at this event **) <br ",

Grandmaster Yury Dokhoian, for many years Garry Kasparov's primary second and later the trainer of Sergey Karjakin, passed away July 1 at the relatively young age of 56 due to COVID-19. He was a strong GM in his youth, though not of the super-elite level, but found his niche when he started working with Kasparov. He was strong enough to be helpful, and had must have had great strength as a person to be able to push against a personality as powerful of Kasparov's. Whil",

Bacrot, a ratings underdog and no longer a member of the elite, scored surprisingly well in the rapid, but Kramnik had a very poor result in the blitz. Apparently Garry Kasparov was concerned about that, but as it turned out he wasn't concerned enough. Ivan Saric did a great job in the rapid, leaving Kasparov only a point out of first going into the blitz, but Kasparov's performance was absolutely disastrous. How bad? Well, his TPR on the first day was lower than *my* rating. He lost in round one to to Jorden Van Foreest and drew with Alexander Grischuk ",

Vladimir Kramnik has been proposing various chess variants over the last few years, and he'll put it to the test against the greatest player from the land where chess (probably) started (India) - his great rival Viswanathan Anand.

However, the transition between the phases isn't always clear. In the following game, it contains elements of both the middlegame (significant material on the board, not safe to bring the king out) and the ending (pawn promotion is the goal). John Nunn might consider this a 'tactical ending', while Mihail Marin refers to it as the 'Fourth Phase'. It turned out that the win depended on both features being present, with the lack of king safety allowing tactics that assisted pawn promotion. <br /> <b>Press,Shaun - Brown,Jordan [E11]",
