One of these places will go to the player with the highest Elo rating in the January 2024 world rankings who has not yet qualified for the Candidates Tournament. A tournament was therefore organised at short notice in Chennai, India, to give Erigaisi and Gukesh a better chance to qualify. Leinier Dominguez tried his luck at the Sunway Sitges Open, while Alireza Firouzja now suddenly has a chance to gain Elo in a series of matches in France.",

This is similar to the successful method Ding Liren used to qualify for the last Candidates. Whilst due to Covid-19 I had some sympathy with Ding trying to play enough games to qualify after an enforced break, this now just doesn't seem right to me.
