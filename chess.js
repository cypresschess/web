Bacrot, a ratings underdog and no longer a member of the elite, scored surprisingly well in the rapid, but Kramnik had a very poor result in the blitz. Apparently Garry Kasparov was concerned about that, but as it turned out he wasn't concerned enough. Ivan Saric did a great job in the rapid, leaving Kasparov only a point out of first going into the blitz, but Kasparov's performance was absolutely disastrous. How bad? Well, his TPR on the first day was lower than *my* rating. He lost in round one to to Jorden Van Foreest and drew with Alexander Grischuk ",

         "description" : "This remarkable lad from Englishtown, New Jersey, playing with great determination under Covid restrictions in Hungary, has scored his third and final GM norm. He has earned the title at the age of 12 years, 4 months, and 25 days, which is 66 days sooner than Sergey Karjakin in 2002. This comes after he had broken the record of youngest US master (at nine years and two months), and youngest International Master ever (at 10 years, nine months, and three days). Congratulations, Abhi!",
