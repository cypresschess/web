Nepomniachtchi played quite a solid Ruy Lopez line against Gukesh. The main point of interest seems to have been whether 19.c3 led anywhere, but this was a computer move rather than a human one. After 19.Rd3 a draw was favourite until the end of the game. Hikaru Nakamura built up a very large advantage by move 18 against Nijat Abasov in a Petroff.",
