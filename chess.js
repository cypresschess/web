So my question is - If you add either the ability to reference books, or be allowed to move pieces while analysing, how much stronger would you be? 100 points, 200 points or more ",

Not many are aware that he wrote his autobiography years before. Our columnist had begun a series on this fascinating work and narrated how it all began. Then came the Ukraine war, and he could not bring himself to write anything in the face of this tragedy. Sadly, the war is continuing, and our columnist has reconciled himself to writing.

Then when you come across an option that exceeds the best option you identified initially, you take that option and stop searching. If you don't find a better choice, then take the best option from your initial research. How does this apply to chess then? On the one hand it probably doesn't, but on the other it may help solve the problem of time management. If you reach a critical phase of the game, and you feel th",

There was a really interesting mixed age group field this year: Jorden Van Foreest, Michael Adams, David Navara, Alexei Shirov, Saleh Salem, Arjun Erigaisi, Nils Grandelius and Hans Moke Niemann. I always have a special feeling about this tournament as it started the same year I was first reporting on chess on the internet. Hans Moke Niemann won his second important tournament in a row after winning the Capablanca Memorial, he scored 5/7 a point clear of Arjun Erigaisi, Nils Grandelius and Michael Adams.",
