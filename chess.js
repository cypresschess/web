Giri started the round half a point behind Abdusattorov and afterwards was grateful to his countryman Jorden Van Foreest for going for a fighting game against the leader. Giri found a way to cause his opponent Richard Rapport problems, may have missed a chance but then his opponent played 34...Kg6 which turned out to be very bad indeed and he soon brought home the full point. Abdusattorov by this time was completely lost and he couldn't find any way to resist. Magnus Carlsen caught Abdusattorov but finished third on tie-break. Giri's consistency in this event has been remarkable and was in ",
