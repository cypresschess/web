However there is now more of a chasing pack on 5.5pts following wins for Yagiz Kaan Erdogmus over Thai Dai Van Nguyen and Jorden Van Foreest who absolutely crushed Vincent Keymer in a sharp London System. The travails of Gukesh continue when he was thoroughly outplayed by Matthias Bluebaum who is now a point off the lead alongside Hans Moke Niemann who now hasn't won since round 4. The final game to finish saw Praggnanandhaa beat Chithambaram Aravindh in a major piece endgame that seems to me likely to be worth studying. Round 9 Standings: 1st Abdusattoro",

But sticking to that sentiment had left me in a bit of a rut. When I moved to London, I threw myself into work: long hours, commuting and networking.

Anish Giri played the inferior 21...Rb8 then just blundered a piece with 22...Bxd4 and also had to resign immediately. Arjun Erigaisi",
