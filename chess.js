In the game Firouzja lost quickly but there are different, and better, ways to play this line. | \"Fast and Furious\" is available on-demand with a ChessBase Premium Account.

Nepomniachtchi had the white pieces against Hikaru Nakamura and they played a well known sequence of moves to draw in only a few minutes. Nakamura said he didn't see any upside to going into a battle with black today where even if he won he was unlikely to overhaul Nepomniachtchi. After other results today Nepomniachtchi now only needs a draw to confirm tournament victory, I rather doubt it will turn out he needs any more points at all. The only decisive result of the day was an almost complete catastrophe with the white pieces for Ding Liren against Teimou",

However, when Rapport avoided the second repetition, he ended up losing his queen for insufficient compensation, with a loss to show for his trouble. After the game Rapport suggested it was the result of poor preparation, although this move he played was already known to be bad.

Nakamura didn't get much out of the opening and the game turned into a very long grind. It seems about move 35 Radjabov started to get into trouble but the whole endgame was very hard to understand for anyone. Nakamura returns to 50% after his loss against Caruana yesterday. This endgame was far too difficult for me to annotate well. The leaders Ian Nepomniachtchi and Fabiano Caruana drew a very complicated Giuoco Piano by repetition in 41 moves. Caruana was well prepared and played bold pawn pushes on the kind ",

At first it was due to the lack of any events in early 2020, but even when online events began, it did not feel like 'real' chess to me. An oddly enough, when face to face events began, there seemed to be a confusing mess of them, with mixed rapid and classical formats. So I tended yo avoid them, both as a blogger and a spectator. So I am pleased to see the Candidates kick off, with a quite exciting round 1. Two decisive games, and two tough draws, were enjoyable to look at. Two of the favourites (Nakamura and Ding) went down, while Duda might be kicking himself after failing to convert a huge opening advant",
