More: in all five games there was at least one moment where one of the players had a very real chance to play for a win. Even in the game between Dariusz Swiercz and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, which was clearly heading for a draw well before the time control, there was a moment when Swiercz had an opportunity for an advantage. Richard Rapport had chances against Sam Shankland on multiple occasions, and Jeffery Xiong had his chances against Wesley So as well. The biggest opportunity belonged to Peter Svidler, but finding 33...b5!! and all the complex, beautiful variations that ensue would have been a real achievement. Ch",

In Pool C (which I was working on), Jersey suffered at the hands of the pairing gods, playing their 3 closest challengers in the last 3 rounds. A narrow loss to Cyprus, and heavy losses to Ethiopia and Angola, saw them slip to 4th place behind these 3. In Pool A, Fiji hoped to do the opposite, finishing with some easier pairings, but a round 9 loss to Lebanon left them 1 win short of qualifying, despite finishing with 3 victories. ",
