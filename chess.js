WR had already been beaten for the World Rapid title by MGD1, a Pune-based group led by India's Arjun Erigaisi. WR lost 2-4 to Germany in their Blitz quarter-final, but got the match annulled on the grounds that they had been advised of the wrong start time so had arrived two minutes late for a three-minute game. All the other teams arrived on time. <a ",

Carlsen's win in the early was a little unusual in that he met all his closest rivals beating Aleksei Sarana in round 7, Jeffery Xiong in round 8, Alireza Firouzja in round 9 and Hans Niemann in round 10 (these finished 2nd-5th). Carlsen drew the final round to finish on 10.5/11. Hans Niemann won the late with 10/11 beating Nakamura in round 9 and drawing with second place Fabiano Caruana in round 10.

Since I can't call everything a rematch I decided to call this a rerematch. After trading wins in the first four games and then having two draws, Giri won six of the last seven games. Even in the drawn game 8 Giri had a winning position for Giri but due to the 50 move rule the game finished in a draw. Only 13 of the schedule 18 games were required for a 9.5-3.5 win for Giri. Niemann can be counted on for a pithy summary, today it was: \"Bad day, very bad day, I'",
