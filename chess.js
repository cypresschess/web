         "description" : " Another 'easy to state, hard to solve' maths/chess problem has been solved recently. The N-Queen problem now has an approximate answer to the question \"How many arrangements can you have of n queens on and n by n chessboard, so that no queen attacks another?\" For a standard board (8x8) it has been long known that there are 92 distinct arrangements, but this problem is the general nxn case, where n can be an extremely large number. The solution (0.143n)^n is of course an approximation (rather than an exact number), but it is close enough to the correct number for all n. If you want to see how this number was arrived at then a link to the paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13460\">he",

Let them show you how Carlsen tailored his openings to be able to outplay his opponents strategically in the middlegame or to obtain an enduring advantage into the endgame, and bear witness to how the Norwegian always managed to find a way to pose his opponents serious problems, even in apparently level endings. This 2nd edition features additional new recordings by all the authors and an extra chapter with a special look at Carlsen by Daniel King.",
