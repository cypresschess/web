In such cases, I feel that playing is far more important than coaching, as self discovery is more helpful than extra instruction. Not always ",

It's very rare to have so many decisive games at such a high level, but for the players, it's a must-win situation, which usually results in a decisive game, one way or the other. The highlight of Round 12 was Giri's win with Black against Fabiano Caruana, but also Nepo's win against Wang Hao, which keeps him at the top of The Candidates with 8 points. Also, MVL achieved his first win at the second part of the to",

Anish didn't only win though, but he gave us a game to remember for many years. Despite the complicated and a bit unpleasant position that Giri had at the middle game, he came up with a great idea that Ding Liren totally neglected, which made the game one to watch! <div class=\"e2-text-picture\"> <img src=\"https://worldchess.com/news/picture",

Nepo gained a quick advantage after Kirill's early mistake in the opening, who tried to create a tactical game afterwards, but with no substantial counterplay. <h2>Three draws</h2> All the other games ended up in a draw, but they weren't indifferent at all.
