Players: Garry Kasparov, Hikaru Nakamura, Fabiano Caruana, Leinier Dominguez Perez, Levon Aronian, Ray Robson, Samuel Sevian, Sam Shankland, Grigoriy Oparin and Wesley So. This is a rapid Fischer Random (Chess960 or 9LX as styled here) tournament and is the last event Kasparov regularly plays in. From a decent plus score in 2021 to a terrible 0.5/9 in 2022 and the only slightly better 3/9 last year the hope is that Kasparov has prepared, at least a little, against what is an extremely tough field. I don't have the ability to actually display the games but will update a game file regularly.",
