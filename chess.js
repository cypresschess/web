Usually, they put a lot of effort into positions that are approximately equal. However, once they get a much better or much worse position, they tend to relax a bit. In an almost winning position, a voice in the head of such a player whispers: \"You are great, my dear, and you have proved that already. The rest of the game is a mere formality.\" And in a lost position, this voice says: \"You have played rubbish. Ok, you have to pretend some fight, but the game is decided already, you will surely be defeated.\" Although psychologically understandable, this approach is wrong. Why? | Photo: Pixabay",

         "description" : " I usually enjoy getting feedback about this blog, even more so when it is face to face. One of the more recent comments (made in person), was that I include lots of 'obscure club games'. While these are normally my own games, I do feature games by other club players (if I can grab the scoresheets). This time however, it is one of my recent games that I will feature. The takeaway from this game is twofold. A missed tempo on the opening can lead to a space disadvantage in the middlegame. This then leads to problems defending an unsafe king. <br /> <b>Press,Shaun - Mildenhall,Stephen [A30]</b><br />Murphy Memorial, 12.04.2022 <script>new PgnViewer( { boardName: \"game1322\", movesFormat: \"defaul",
