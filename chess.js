Fortunately there was quite a large collection of chess books on offer, so I didn't miss out on the bargains. Somewhat shamefully I did by a book on the London System, but I made up for it by grabbing a copy of the Jan Timman classic \"The Art of Chess Analysis\". At first I thought I already owned a copy but it turns out that it was a significant omission from my library. I did grab a few other titles, and also was interviewed by ABC Radio while browsing. As the Book Fair runs until Sunday I will probably make the effort to return towards the end, to see what remains. ",

From the late 90's onwards this flipped, with Australia being the dominate team, but as someone who thought Australia ay never win a series against the West Indies, I'm OK with todays result.
