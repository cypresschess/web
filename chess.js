In this game from the current Bangkok Open, GM Hrant Melkumyan demonstrates this quite effectively, opening a file that his opponent already has a rook on, but one without entry points into Black's position. After the Black rook moves to b8, it is Black that not only takes over the b file, but also the 7th and 8th ranks. After that, White is forced to defend a host of weak pawns, which eventually, he is unable to do. <br /> <b>Markovitz,Neil (1962) - Melkumyan,",

It will be the 19-year-old's first event since launching his $100m lawsuit against the world champion, Magnus Carlsen, and others. Niemann is nationally ranked only No 8, so it is possible that some of those with higher ratings, including Hikaru Nakamura, who is among those being sued, and the current US champion, Fabiano Caruana, have declined to play in the same squad as the teenager. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com",

         "description" : " In the pre-computer days, the most common way to improve at chess was to study games played by stronger players. So entrenched was this method that most \"How to Play Chess\" books included a collection of master games, usually with very light annotations. One example was from the Meises update to RF Green's \"Chess\". It included 33 games, including the following early example, from 1834. Given the lack of notes (or analysis) for the game, I suspect the expectation was that the reader would play through the game, and basically improve by self realisation. While this may sound unrealistic today, it was a method that seemed to work. <br /> <b>De Labourdonnais,Louis Charles Mahe - McDonnell,Alexa",
