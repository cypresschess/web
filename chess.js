In the final round Tan played a very sharp Sicilian against Anna Muzychuk. Tan secured a big advantage but steered the game to the draw she needed. Lei needed a win and played an amazing Queen sacrifice against Humpy Koneru. Eventually her compensation disappeared and she subsided to a loss. ",

Gukesh should play Ding Liren later in the year for the World Title.
