In the only other decisive game Yagiz Kaan Erdogmus beat Jorden Van Foreest in a game settled near first time control, both players missed big ideas in spite of not being in serious time trouble. The other games were drawn. Matthias Bluebaum was pretty upset with himself that he didn't convert winning chances against Arjun Erigaisi. Aravindh Chithambaram was dead lost against Javokhir Sindarov who blew the win with his final move before time control with only a few seconds left.",
