(If one thinks that a sport must have an athletic component, chess isn't a sport; if it's not necessary, then it is.) Going further, if one thinks that Olympic sports ought to have some plausible connection with what the ancient Greeks and Romans did, then the idea that chess should be an Olympic sport is ludicrous - but then so is figure skating, rhythmic gymnastics, and curling.

They drew all four games the first day, thus splitting the first mini-match 2-2, and Carlsen won game three on the second day and won the second mini-match, and thus the overall match, 2.5-1.5.
