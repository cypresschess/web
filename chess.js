Looking back at a number of older (pre engine) games is that their are often errors in analysis. The main reason for this seems to be that a lot of strong moves are overlooked at the top of the tree, either because it isn't part of an existing plan, or the assumption that the opponent is restricted to one or two choices.

Even a draw would see Carlsen reach 7, so the worse that could happen was a round of tie-breaks. Going into this game I can't see Nepo pulling back a full point. He might draw the game, postponing the inevitable, or over press, resulting in a win for Carlsen (in a similar ending to the 2013 World Championship Match). If I was a betting man, I would give Carlsen a 33% change of winning, and a 66% chance of it being a draw. <br /> ",
