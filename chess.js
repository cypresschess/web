A total of 44 players turned up to play, which is a good number to start the year. I was called in as the 'house man' for the Ramakrishna Memorial, and got off to a good start, scoring a nice win in 17 moves. After my opponents 8th move, I decided to check out 9.e4 as a response, and having looked at enough lines to convince me it worked, played it. I had calculated that I was better up until around move 14, and when I reached that point, realised I had a pretty quick checkmate, which my opponent kindly let me play on the board. <br />",

From the late 90's onwards this flipped, with Australia being the dominate team, but as someone who thought Australia ay never win a series against the West Indies, I'm OK with todays result.

         "description" : " The fifth round of the Tata Steel Masters saw just two decisive games, wins for Gukesh over Ian Nepomniachtchi and Ju Wenjun over Alireza Firouzja. The latter result meant that Anish Giri extended his lead in the tournament to a point. Giri was under some pressure by Praggnanandhaa but this was gone by first time control. In the remaining games Vidit drew with Max Warmerdam, Alexander Donchenko drew with Jorden Van Foreest, Nodirbek Abdusattorov drew with Wei Yi and Parham Maghsoodloo drew with Ding Liren. 6 out of 7 games in the Challengers were decisive leaving Erwin L'Ami in the lead on 4/5. Eline Roebers beat joint leader Hans Moke Niemann to get off the mark. Round 5 Standings: 1st Gir",
