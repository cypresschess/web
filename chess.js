Ploy was a 2 or 4 player game, where the direction the pieces could move was imprinted on the piece itself (each piece was a disk). Some pieces had a single direction, while more powerful pieces had 2,3 or 4 directions. However, the pieces could be rotated, instead of moving, to enable them to move in entirely different directions. Although the game is out of print, it can be played at various online game platforms.

For me, the right to say dumb, hurtful, stupid, offensive or ignorant words, is met with the right to say that the first speaker is dumb, hurtful, stupid, offensive and ignorant. In the case of Karjakin, his comments have been rightfully condemned, his invitations to tournaments are likely to disappear, and anything he says is countered by people who point out he is lying about many things.

Teams are starting to get themselves organised for the Olympiad, and there is also talk of a possible Oceania Juniors in 2022 (or 23), and an Oceania Seniors. Unlike almost all other FIDE zones, air travel is the key to the success of these events, so hopefully the opening of borders between the various countries will see renewed enthusiasm for these tournaments. <br /> ",
