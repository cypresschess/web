         "description" : " For a brief moment, chess.com thought it would be a good idea to organise a $1,000,000 World Championship. The problem wasn't the prize money, which is certainly a hefty amount, but the name. As there is already an official World Championship, and I'm assuming FIDE haven't sold it off, there might have been a legal problem. So instead of a World Championship, the chess.com event is now the Global Championship. With this change I'm assuming everyone is now happy, except for the afore mentioned flat earthers. ",
