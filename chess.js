The first is to efficiently cover the 4 squares in front of them, and the second is to support the necessary pawn break often needed to transform the position into a better on. On the following rapid game, I had the former, but not the later. But this was because my opponent felt the lack of space in his position required a pawn grab, which unfortunately for him, was unsound. <br /> <b>Press,Shaun - Rowe,Arief [D06]</b><br />Gungahlin Rapid (1), 21.03.2023 <script>new PgnViewer( { boardName: \"game1389\", movesFormat: \"default\", pgnStrin",
