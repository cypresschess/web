Nepo and Nakamura have the toughest assignments, playing each other in round 13 and then Caruana and Gukesh respectively in the last round. Gukesh has an out of form Firouzja in round 13, while Caruana is playing a much tougher Prag. At this stage Gukesh seems to have the best run home, but this could all change if Nakamura can pull off the big final round comeback. <br /> <b>Caruana,Fabiano (2803) - Vidit,Santosh Gujrathi (2727) [C54]</b><br /> FIDE Candidates 2024 Toronto, Canada (12.4), 18.04.2024 <script> new PgnViewer( { b",

Nepomniachtchi played quite a solid Ruy Lopez line against Gukesh. The main point of interest seems to have been whether 19.c3 led anywhere, but this was a computer move rather than a human one. After 19.Rd3 a draw was favourite until the end of the game. Hikaru Nakamura built up a very large advantage by move 18 against Nijat Abasov in a Petroff.",

Apparently this had disturbed at least one other player, who had complained to Aris. Firouzja was not happy about the request, and after the round complained on social media. As an Arbiter, I've also had to deal with this issue from time to time. It usually occurs when the venue has hard wood floors, and more formal shoes (ie not sandshoe",
