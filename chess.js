As Nimzovitch first pointed out, the role of the open file is to get your rook to the 7th or 8th rank. In this game from the current Bangkok Open, GM Hrant Melkumyan demonstrates this quite effectively, opening a file that his opponent already has a rook on, but one without entry points into Black's position. After the Black rook moves to b8, it is Black that not only takes over the b file, but also the 7th and 8th ranks. After that, White is forced to defend a host of weak pawns, which eventually, he is unable to do. <br /> <b>Markovitz,Neil (1962) - Melkumyan,",

         "description" : " In the pre-computer days, the most common way to improve at chess was to study games played by stronger players. So entrenched was this method that most \"How to Play Chess\" books included a collection of master games, usually with very light annotations. One example was from the Meises update to RF Green's \"Chess\". It included 33 games, including the following early example, from 1834. Given the lack of notes (or analysis) for the game, I suspect the expectation was that the reader would play through the game, and basically improve by self realisation. While this may sound unrealistic today, it was a method that seemed to work. <br /> <b>De Labourdonnais,Louis Charles Mahe - McDonnell,Alexa",

After a few more events, he scored his 3rd norm at the October First Saturday event in Budapest, finishing on 7/9 and performing at 2610. Song, who formerly played for Australia (and NZ), now represents Chinese Taipei and only needs to get his rating above 2500 to confirm the title.
