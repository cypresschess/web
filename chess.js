While the Schliemann in and of itself isn't that bad, there are some pretty dubious lines, especially now with chess engines ruining most gambits. I ventured the Mohring variation, which is known to be poor as long ago as the early 1980's, hoping my opponent might miss the best line. When he played 12 moves of theory I began to (a) regret my decision to choose this line and (b) try and remember what I used to know 35 years ago. Luckily he missed the the correct defensive move (13.d4!) and after that his position collapsed very quickly. <br /> <b>Cunningham,Cam - Press,Shaun [C63]</b><br />Belconnen Cup, 24.05.2022 <s",

Then when you come across an option that exceeds the best option you identified initially, you take that option and stop searching. If you don't find a better choice, then take the best option from your initial research. How does this apply to chess then?
