Although his points have come from draws (plus one loss) he has picked up rating points from each game due to the strength of his opponents. The field isn't quite as strong as the recently completed Sharjah event, but it still attracted 49 GM's in the 86 player field. For the non GM's this can lead to some tough games, as this game from the 1st round demonstrates. <br /> <b>Bai,Adelard (2409) - Chigaev,Maksim (2628) [E17]</b><br /> Dubai Open 2023 - Category A Dubai Chess & Culture Club, Un (1.12), 27.05.2023 <script> new PgnV",

Sadly this has been a trend in the print media of late, with Ian's Sydney Morning Herald column dropped in 2020, only to be saved by a concerted letter writing campaign.
