He might draw the game, postponing the inevitable, or over press, resulting in a win for Carlsen (in a similar ending to the 2013 World Championship Match). If I was a betting man, I would give Carlsen a 33% change of winning, and a 66% chance of it being a draw. <br /> ",

Today Nepomniachtchi chose to repeat the Petroff Defence he played in games 4 and 8 - a solid continuation which often leads to symmetrical pawn structures. This has been a point scoring weapon for black in recent years only because white often has to play slightly riskily to get decent winning chances - white pretty much always has the option to go for the most symbolic of advantages where a draw is a high probability.
